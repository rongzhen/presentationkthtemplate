\begin{abstract}

\noindent In order to reduce the high dependence on fossil fuels and oil, solar energy is one of the alternatives.
There are several very important absorber materials in the thin film photovlotaic technology, such as, the chalcopyrite $\cigs$ (CIGS), $\czts$ (CZTS) and $\cztse$ (CZTSe),
the efficiency of CIGS has been reached up to around 20\%, so the accurate information for this kind of absorber materials is of great importance in order to
design the photovlotaic (PV) materials. 

\noindent In this licenciate, the parameterization of the band dispersion for the uppermost three valence bands (VBs) and the lowest conduction
band (CB) in CIGS with $x=0, 0.5$, and $1$ is explored, which is based on the $k \cdot p$ method, but extended it up to high order. It demonstates that the VBs and CB
are quite non-parabolic away from the $\Gamma$ point, which means that the effecive mass on $\Gamma$ point is not suitable to discribe the materials properties like 
band filling and strong excitation effects. At last, the $\varepsilon$ spectra of $CuIn_{0.5}Ga_{0.5}Se_2$ is calculated, and compared with the
experiment result from $CuIn_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}Se_2$ at 40 K, which demonstates that the overall shape of $\varepsilon$ spectra both of calculated and experimented 
is in good agreement.

\noindent The lowest CB and three uppermost VBs of CIGS is parameterized in order to better understand and discribe the anisotropy and non-parabolic of the energy dispersion.
In order to illustrate the non-parabolic of the band dispersion, the effective electron and hole mass tensors are abtained in four symmetry directions, to futher illustrate
the non-parabolic, the constant energy surface are calculated for the three topmost VBs as well as the lowest CB. Based on the non-parabolic parameterization and compared
with parabolic band energy approximation, the density-of-states (DOS), Fermi energy and the carrier concentrations are calculated and analyzed. To summarize, one can better
understand and analyze the electrical properties in the CIGS alloys.


\noindent The $\varepsilon$ spectra of $CuIn_{0.5}Ga_{0.5}Se_2$ is determined by the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations (FPLAPW), which shows a good 
agreement with the result from Spectroscopic ellipsometry, which illustrates the result of $CuIn_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}Se_2$ at 40 K, furthermore, the probable electronic origins of 
observed interband critical points (CP) is discussed, and the electronic origins of each CP are examined based on the results from the FPLAPW calculations. At 
last, the band to band analysis of the contribution to the total ${\varepsilon_2}$ spectrum is explored.

\chapter{Introduction }
%need to discribe more about CIGS material more about 3 to 4 pages.
With the increasing of energy consumption, more and more energy or power is needed. The required energy is mainly satisfied by the fossil fuels and oil, unfortunately,
which is very limited energy, one day they will be dispeared if keeping the current pace to use. So it is urgent to explore more sustainable and healthy energy source,
solar energy is one of the answer since it is abundant and clean. 

So far, the solar cell based on silicon dominate the solar world, however, silicon is an indirect band gap material, moreover, it is very expensive to fabricate the PV device,
so more and more thin film solar cells based on some absorber materials also are catching up recentely, such as copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and so on. 
CIGS and CdTe both of them are direct band gap material, especitally, the conversion efficiency of CIGS already reached up to 20.4\% by the scientist in the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology at the moment, who develop the thin film solar cells on flexible polymer foils.

CIGS material takes the attention from different researchers' group in the world since the higher conversion efficiency, so there are plenty of papers already published to 
illustrate the different aspects of CIGS, for example,


In this licentiate, the research material is CIGS, the motivation is that CIGS is a very promising thin film absorber material, although the macroscopic properties of CIGS already
are farily well understood, there are only little researchs about the details of the electronic energy band dispersion near the uppermost VBs and CB, which is important
for analyzing and understanding electrical properties. So the objective of this licentiate is to improve the parabolic band dispersion approximation by parametering the band dispersion using the higher order expasion of the traditional k $\cdot$ p method. In this
licenciate, the parameterization of the energy bands for the three uppermost VBs and the lowest CB is presented, and compared with results from the parabolic band approximation
and non-parablic band dispersion. And also, since the low temperature SE study of CIGS is rare, so the ${\varepsilon}$ spectra of CIGS is compared and analysed by 
experment and theoretical calculation.

\section{The quantum many-body problem}
\label{ch:mb}

\noindent The solid is a set which includes a huge amount of atoms (around $10^{23}/cm^3$), and the atom is constructed by nuclei and electrons. 
According to the quantum mechanics principles, we will know all the properties of solid matter if we can figure out a way to solve 
the quantum many-body Schr?dinger equation exactly. Let us start from the time-independent many-body Schr?dinger equation,

 
\begin{equation}\label{ssth}
 {\hath} {\wf} = {E} {\wf}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\wf$  is the exact wavefunction for the above Schr?dinger equation, $\textbf{r}_\textit{i}$ and $\textbf{R}_\textit{I}$  stands for electron and nucleus coordinators,
respectively, $E$ is the energy of the system, $\hath$ is Hamiltonian which has the following form:

\begin{equation}\label{th}\begin{split}
&\hath = - \sumi<i> {\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m_\textit{e}}}   \nablai2<i> - \sumi<I> {\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 M_\textit{I}}} \nablai2<I>  - \sumij<i><I> \frac{Z_\textit{I}\ e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 |\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{R}_\textit{I}|} \\
& + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> \frac{ e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 |\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{r}_\textit{j}|} + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<I><J> \frac{Z_\textit{I} Z_\textit{J}\  e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 |\textbf{R}_\textit{I}-\textbf{R}_\textit{J}|}
\end{split}\end{equation}


\noindent where the indices $\textit{i}$, $\textit{j}$ are used for electron and $\textit{I}$, $\textit{J}$ are used for atomic nuclei, $Z_\textit{I}$ means the charge of the $\textit{I}$-th nucleus,
here  $\textit{I}$ is a number, and ($\textit{I}$)-th means the ordinal number of $\textit{I}$, $\textit{M}$ denotes nuclear mass, $m_e$ is the electron mass, $\varepsilon_0$ is vacuum permittivity.

\noindent The equation \ref{th} has the following form in atomic units:
\
\begin{equation}\label{sth}\begin{split}
&\hath = - \sumi<i>   \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{i}}^{2}}}{2} - \sumi<I> \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}^{2}}}{2 M_\textit{I}}  - \sumij<i><I> \frac{Z_\textit{I}}{|\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{R}_\textit{I}|} \\
& + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> \frac{1}{ |\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{r}_\textit{j}|} + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<I><J> \frac{Z_\textit{I} Z_\textit{J}\ }{|\textbf{R}_\textit{I}-\textbf{R}_\textit{J}|}
\end{split}\end{equation}


\noindent In equation \ref{sth}, the first and second terms are the kinetic energy operator of the electron and nuclei, respectively,
and the other terms in order are Coulomb interaction between electrons and nuclei, electrons and electrons and nuclei and nuclei.

\noindent Since there are so many atoms to calculate in reality, more importantly, we don't know exactly the form of the wavefunction neither,
so we can not solve the equation \ref{ssth} exactly at present, but people already figure out some ways to approximate the exact solution. 
Generally we can divide these approximations into three different levels, the first level is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the second level is Hartree,
Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) and kohn-sham (KS) equation, the last level is the approximation for solving the secular equation, which is an equation that is solved to find the eigenvalue of matrix.

\section{The Born-Oppenheimer approximation}
\label{ch:boa}
\noindent In order to simplify the equation  \ref{ssth}, the first attempt is to seperate the wavefunction of electrons and nuclei, i.e., 
$\wf = {\theta(\textbf{R})} {\Psi(\textbf{r})} $, but since there is a couple term between the electron and nucleus in the Schr?dinger Hamitonian in equation \ref{sth}, 
so we can not do that simply. On the other hand, let us look at the equation
\ref{sth} again, and we can find that there is a ?small? value ${1}/{M}$, which is part of the nucleus kinetic energy
operator term, the reason is that the mass of nucleus is much larger than that of electron, so if we treat the mass
as infinity, the result is that the electron is seen as interacting under both the ?external? potential caused by nuclei that are fixed in 
some positions and that of other electrons. We can see more vividly description from Figure 1 below.
%figure
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{system.eps}
%\includegraphics[scale=.5]{kth_svv_indu_eng_manage.eps}
\caption{Left one: normal interacting system. Right one. The born-Oppenheimer approximation. The arrow denotes the movement of the nucleus or electron}
\label{fig:bo}
\end{figure}

\noindent The separation of motion between electrons and nuclei is called the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, since the position of nuclei is fixed, so we can define

\begin{equation}\label{nwf}
{\wf}  {\approx}  {\Psi_{ \textit{bo}} ( \{ {\textbf{r}_{\textit{i}}},\textbf{R} \}) } = {\theta(\textbf{R})} {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})}
\end{equation}

 \noindent where $\Psi_{ \textit{bo}} ( \{ {\textbf{r}_{\textit{i}}},\textbf{R} \})$  is the wavefunction of electrons for Born-Oppenheimer approximation, $\textbf R$ is only discrete value belonging to the set of atomic positions, 
 so now, we can recheck the equation \ref{sth} again, we find out that the term of nuclei kinetic is gone, the term of interacting
 between nuclei is simplified as a constant. Now, we can redefine the equation \ref{sth} as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{both}\begin{split}
&{\hath}_\textit{bo}\ =\ - \sumi<i>   \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{i}}^{2}}}{2}  - \sumi<i> V_{ext}(\textbf{r}_{\textit{i}})  + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> \frac{1}{ |\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{r}_\textit{j}|} + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<I><J> \frac{Z_\textit{I} Z_\textit{J}\ }{|\textbf{R}_\textit{I}-\textbf{R}_\textit{J}|} \\
&\ = \ \hat{T} \ + \ \hat{V}_\textit{ext} \ + \ \hat{V}_\textit{int}\ + \ N_\textit{II}
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent where ${\hath}_\textit{bo}$  is the Hamitonian corresponding the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the second term is the nuclei potential acting on the
electrons, 

\begin{equation}
V_{ext}(\textbf{r}_{\textit{i}}) =  \sumi<I> \frac{Z_\textit{I}}{|\textbf{r}_\textit{i}-\textbf{R}_\textit{I}|}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the subscript ?$ext$? in the second term means ?$external$?, so this term is about external potentials interaction. 
The corresponding Schr?dinger equation is:

\begin{equation}\label{bose}
{\hath}_{bo} \wfbo = E_\textit{bo} {\wfbo}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E_\textit{bo}$ is the energy of this electronic system. So far,
the discussion above is only considering the Schr?dinger equation of electron, i.e., equation \ref{bose}, so how about the Schr?dinger equation of nucleus? First, comparing equation
\ref{sth} and \ref{both}, we can rewrite the total Schr?dinger Hamitonian as 

\begin{equation}\label{nh}
 {\hath} = - \sumi<I> \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}^{2}}}{2 M_\textit{I}} + {\hath}_{bo}
\end{equation}

\noindent so the new Schr?dinger equation with equation \ref{nh} and \ref{nwf} is 

\begin{equation}
 (- \sumi<I> \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}^{2}}}{2 M_\textit{I}} + {\hath}_{bo} ) ( {\theta(\textbf{R})} {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})}) = E_{m}({\textbf R}) ({\theta(\textbf{R})} {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})} )
\end{equation}
 
\noindent where $E_{m}$ is the total energy of above system, after some steps of derivation, we can end up with the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{ise}
( \hat{H}_{I1}+\hat{H}_{I2}+\hat{H}_{I3}+E_{bo}({\textbf R}) ) {\theta(\textbf{R})} = {E_m} {\theta(\textbf{R})}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
 &  \hat{H}_{I1} = - \sumi<I> \frac{{{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}^{2}}}{2 M_\textit{I}}   \\
 &  \hat{H}_{I2} = - \sumi<I> \frac{1}{M_\textit{I}} {\int {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})}^{\ast} {{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}} {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})} d {\textbf r }} {{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}} \\
 &  \hat{H}_{I3} = - \sumi<I> \frac{1}{M_\textit{I}} {\int {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})}^{\ast} {{\nabla}_{\textit{I}}^{2}} {\Psi(\textbf{r}, \textbf{R})} d {\textbf r }} 
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent from equation \ref{ise}, we obsever that we can get the lattice dynamical properties of certain system within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and in this equation,
we also need the gournd state energy $E_{bo}({\textbf R})$ of electron system to solve equation \ref{ise}, here $\textbf R$ is the parametrilized value from the atom position.
 

\noindent In summary, we derive the Schr?dinger equation of electron and nucleus seperatly in this section, and usually, when we refer to calculate the ground state properties,
we means to take use of the Schr?dinger equation of electron only, e.g., equation \ref{bose}, and we use Schr?dinger equation of nucleus for the calculation of lattice dynamics.

So far, we notice that the equation \ref{both} is much simpler than equation \ref{sth}, but still not solvable, so we need further more excellent approximations 
to solve this many-body problem.


\section{Hartree and Hartree-Fock approximation}
\noindent Hartree or Hartree-Fock method is straightforward to get the 
expression we are expecting using the mathematical approaches, and both of them focus on the treatment of wavefunction, however, the wavefunction in Hartree method is not 
flexible enough, and better but not enough (lacking of correlation term) in Hartree Fock method.

%the density functional theory (DFT) is a perfect method which can solve the 
%many-body equation in theory, but not solvable in practice

\subsection{Hartree approximation}
\label{ha}
\noindent The simplest approximation of the wavefunction for many-body Schr?dinger equation is the form of acting like non-interacting 
electrons, so the wavefunction with N non-interacting electrons has the following expression:

\begin{equation}\label{wfh}
\wfh = \bwf<1><1> \bwf<2><2> \cdots \bwf<N><N> 
\end{equation}

\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}\label{wfh}
\langle \rangle
\end{equation}
\end{comment}


\noindent where $i$ goes through all the electrons, and  means state of the $i$-th electron in the position of ${\textbf{r}}_{\textit{i}}$, 
from here and following the $R$ is suppressed in the wavefunction since they are position fixed. So the total energy of the system we can write down in the following way :

\begin{equation}\label{teh}
E_{\textit{h}} = <\wfh |\ {\hath}_{\textit{bo}} \ | \wfh  >
\end{equation}

\noindent So making the substitution using equation \ref{both} and \ref{wfh} into equation \ref{teh}, we can get the total energy of system:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
&E_\textit{h} = \sumi<i> <\bwf<i><> |\ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textit r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})  \ | \bwf<i><> > \\
& +\frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> <\bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>>
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent In order to calculate the stationary state of the system, so the variation of the wavefunction should be
zero variation in the energy, so here we can set up the following equation with Lagrange multiplier $E^{i}_h$
\begin{equation}\label{haa}
 \delta [ E_{\textit{h}} - \sumi<i> E^{i}_{h} (<\bwf<i><> | \bwf<i><> > -1)] = 0 
\end{equation}

\noindent In order to calculate the term $\delta ( E_{\textit{h}} ) $, we have to know
\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{hartree1}
& \delta ( \sumi<i> <\bwf<i><> |\ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textbf r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})  \ | \bwf<i><> > ) \\
&  = \sumi<i> \{ < \delta \bwf<i><> |\ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textbf r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})  \ | \bwf<i><> >  
   + <  \delta \bwf<i><> |\ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textbf r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})  \ |  \bwf<i><> >^{\ast} \}
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent and 

\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{hartree2}
&  \delta( \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> <\bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>>)   \\
& =   \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> \{  <\delta \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>>  \\
& +   < \bwf<i><> \delta \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>> +  T_{rem}\}
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent where $T_{rem}$ is the remaining terms, actually these remaining terms will not affect the derivation. Before getting the final result, 
there is one more identity 

\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{hartreelabel1}
& < \bwf<i><> \delta \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>> \\
& = \int d \textbf{r} d \textbf{r}{'}  \phi_{i}^{*} (\textbf{r}{}) \delta \phi_{j}^{*} (\textbf{r}{'}) \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |}  \phi_{i}^{} (\textbf{r}{})  \phi_{j}^{} (\textbf{r}{'})\\
& = \int d \textbf{r}{'} d \textbf{r}  \phi_{i}^{*} (\textbf{r}{'}) \delta \phi_{j}^{*} (\textbf{r}{}) \frac{1}{|\textbf{r}{'} - \textbf{r} |}  \phi_{i}^{} (\textbf{r}{'})  \phi_{j}^{} (\textbf{r})\\
& = <\delta \bwf<j><> \bwfn<i><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<j><> \bwfn<i><'>>
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent So the equation \ref{hartree2} will become 

\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{hartree3}
&  \delta( \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> <\bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>>)   \\
& =  \suminj<i><j> \{  <\delta \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>> + \frac{T_{rem}}{2}\}
\end{split}\end{equation}


Taking use of the above two equation \ref{haa}, \ref{hartree1}, \ref{hartree3} and variation in the term of  $\delta \phi^{*}_{i}(\textbf{r}{}) $,
finally we end up with
\begin{equation}\label{hha}
(-\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textbf r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})+ \suminj<j><i> <\bwfn<j><'>\ | \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwfn<j><'>>) \bwf<i><> = E^{i}_{h} \bwf<i><>
\end{equation}
\noindent where $E^{i}_{h}$  also can be treated as the energy corresponding the ($i$)-th electron in the position of  $\textbf{r}$, the equation \ref{hha} is a group of dependent single
 particle equations, and after checking it, we can find out which is an equation that is self-consistent and can be solved using
 computer by iteratively.

 respectively, and $\delta$ is the tolerance.

\subsection{Hartree-Fock approximation}
\noindent Hartree approximation is the lowest level approximation, and Hartree-Fock approximation is the method which considers the 
antisymmetry of the wavefunction, which means that if the positions of two electrons (with same spin) are exchanged, the wave 
function should change the sign, like:
\begin{equation}\label{hfwf}
\Psi_\textit{hf} (\{ \cdots \textbf{r}_\textit{i} \cdots  \textbf{r}_\textit{j} \}) = - \Psi_\textit{hf} (\{ \cdots \textbf{r}_\textit{j} \cdots  \textbf{r}_\textit{i} \})
\end{equation}
\noindent Slater introduced  an excellent way to construct the wavefunction due to the equation \ref{hfwf} based on the Hartree approximation, 
the wavefunction of many- body Schr?dinger equation is written down  in a matrix determinant way for the number of $N$ electrons 
(without spin):
\begin{equation}\label{hfwfm}
\Psi_{hf}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{r}_N) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \left|
\begin{matrix}
    \bwf<1><1> & \bwf<1><2> & \cdots & \bwf<1><N> \\
    \bwf<2><1> & \bwf<1><2> & \cdots & \bwf<1><N> \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
    \bwf<N><1> & \bwf<N><2> & \cdots & \bwf<N><N>
\end{matrix} \right|
\end{equation}
\noindent where $i$ goes through all the electron, and $\bwf<i><i>$ means state of the ($i$)-th electron in the position of $\textbf{r}_\textit{i}$, so if we exchange two rows
 in the equation \ref{hfwfm}, we will find out the result is satisfied with the equation \ref{hfwf}.

\noindent Now repeating all the processes already done through the Hartree approximation , we will know the total energy of Hartree-Fock as follows:

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
&E_\textit{hf} = \sumi<i> <\bwf<i><> |\ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textit r}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})  \ | \bwf<i><> > \\
& + \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> <\bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwf<i><> \bwfn<j><'>> \\
& - \frac{1}{2} \suminj<i><j> <\bwfn<i><'> \bwfn<j><>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwfn<i><> \bwfn<j><'>>
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent In the same mathematical skill but more complicated like in previous section, we can get the dependent singe particle Hartree-Fock equation:

\begin{equation}\begin{split}
& \{ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textit i}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})+ \suminj<j><i> <\bwfn<j><'>\ | \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwfn<j><'>> \} \bwf<i><>  \\
& - \suminj<i><j>  < \bwfn<j><'>|\ \frac{1}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |} \ | \bwfn<i><'> >) \bwfn<j><>  = E^{i}_{hf} \bwf<i><>
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent Comparing with Hartree equation, there is an extra term in the equation above, which is called exchange term, and at the same time,
 in order to organize the equation in a nice and clear way, finally we define:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
\{ -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{\textit i}}{2} + V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) +V_\textit{H}(\textbf{r}) \}  \bwf<i><>  = E^{i}_{hf}   \bwf<i><> 
\end{split}\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 V_\textit{H}(\textbf{r})= \int \frac{\rho(\textbf{r}{'}) - \rho_{\textit{i}}^{\textit{HF}}(\textbf{r},\textbf{r}{'})}{|\textbf{r} - \textbf{r}^{'} |}  \mathrm{d}\textbf{r}^{'}
\end{equation}
and $ \rho_{\textit{i}}^{\textit{HF}}(\textbf{r},\textbf{r}{'}) = \sumi<j> \frac{\phi_{i}^{}(\textbf{r}{'}) \phi_{i}^{*}(\textbf{r}{}) \phi_{j}^{}(\textbf{r}{}) \phi_{j}^{*}(\textbf{r}{'})} {\phi_{i}^{}(\textbf{r}) \phi_{i}^{*}(\textbf{r})} $ 
; $\rho(\textbf{r}) = \sumi<i>  {|\bwf<i><>|}^{2}$ . And also we find that we can solve it in the same way like Hartree approximation but plus one
extra term.

\section{Density functional theory}
\noindent Hartree and Hartree-Fock methods are very classic methods to solve many-body Schr?dinger equation. However, HF method only includes the exchange,
 but badly in the electron correlation, so they are not suitable in the case of electrons in solid. Apart from the two methods mentioned before, there is another modern method to deal with
 the more complicated calculation of electrons, namely, density functional theory (DFT), which is introduced by Hohenberg and
 Kohn in 1964, Kohn and Pople was awarded by Chemistry Nobel Prize in 1998.

\noindent The idea of this method is to treat the electron density of solid instead of using the many-particle wavefunction, so we can
 benefit that the degree of freedom reduces from 3N (N is the number of electrons) to 3, which is apparently less complicate than 
those of Hartree and Hartree-Fock during calculation. 

\subsection{The Density as Basic Variable}
\noindent There are two questions coming out if we consider the electron density as the role of wavefunction. The first one is whether it
 is the equivalence relation between the electron density and wavefunction of the system, and the second one is how to solve this 
problem. In order to know that there are two very basic theorems introduced by Hohenberg and Kohn:

\begin{thm}
\label{hk1}
\noindent The first theorem says that the external potential $V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})$  is determined uniquely for any of electon system by the ground state electron density $\rho_0$.
\end{thm}

\noindent The above theorem also indicate that all the ground state properties are decied by the true ground state density $\rho_0$,
for example, the total energy E=E[$\rho_0$]. 
\noindent The above theorem also explains the equivalence relation between the electron density and wavefunction, because Hamiltonian is obtained from external potentials,
then one can get the wavefunction, so the corresponding electron density is determined, however, from the theorem, the external potential is unique decided by electron
density, so the electron density contains the same information of wavefunction.

\noindent The proof of theorem is following:

\noindent Now, let us assume that there exsits two external potentials named $V^{1}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})$ and $V^{2}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})$ leading to the same ground state 
electron density $\rho_0$, but obviously, which will lead to two different Hamiltonians, that is, $\hat{H}_{1}$ and $\hat{H}_{2}$, and as well as two different corresponding
wavefunctions named $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$. Since $\Psi_1$ are not the ground state wavefunction of $\hat{H}_{2}$, the same rules to $\Psi_2$ and $\hat{H}_{1}$, so two following
inequality equations will be satisfied:

\begin{equation}\label{hkpf1}\begin{split}
&  E_1 = \langle \Psi_1\ |\hat{H}_{1}|\ \Psi_1 \rangle  \ < \  \langle \Psi_2\ |\hat{H}_{1}|\ \Psi_2 \rangle\\
&  E_2 = \langle \Psi_2\ |\hat{H}_{2}|\ \Psi_2 \rangle  \ < \  \langle \Psi_1\ |\hat{H}_{2}|\ \Psi_1 \rangle
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent Taking advangtage of the form of Hamitonian from equation \ref{both}, one can get:
\begin{equation}\label{hkpf2}\begin{split}
&    \langle \Psi_2\ |\hat{H}_{1}|\ \Psi_2 \rangle \\
&  = \langle \Psi_2\ |\hat{H}_{2} + \hat{H}_{1} - \hat{H}_{2}|\ \Psi_2 \rangle \\
&  = \langle \Psi_2\ |\hat{H}_{2} |\Psi_2 \rangle + \langle \Psi_2 | \hat{H}_{1} - \hat{H}_{2}|\ \Psi_2 \rangle \\
&  = E_2 + \int d \textbf{r} ( V^{1}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) - V^{2}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) )  \rho_0
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent So using \ref{hkpf1} and \ref{hkpf2}, one can get:

\begin{equation}\label{hkpf3}
 E_1  < \  E_2 + \int d \textbf{r} ( V^{1}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) - V^{2}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) )  \rho_0
\end{equation}

\noindent Another similar inequality equation will be gained if one changes the form of equation $\langle \Psi_1\ |\hat{H}_{2}|\ \Psi_1 \rangle$ like equation \ref{hkpf2}.
\begin{equation}\label{hkpf4}
  E_2  < \  E_1 + \int d \textbf{r} ( V^{2}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) - V^{1}_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r}) )  \rho_0
\end{equation}

\noindent so plus the left and right sides from equation \ref{hkpf3} and \ref{hkpf4}, one will gain a contradictory result:
\begin{equation}\label{hkpf4}
  E_1 + E_2  < \  E_2 + E_1
\end{equation}

\noindent So the external potential $V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})$ is unique.

\begin{thm}
\label{hk2}
\noindent The second theorem says that there is a universal functional for the total energy in the terms of the electron density $\rho$ with any external potential $V_\textit{ext}(\textbf{r})$ ,
and the exact ground state density is gained when the ground state total energy functional reaches its minimal value, that is, E[$\rho$]>E[$\rho_0$], where $\rho$ is not the ground state density.
\end{thm}

\noindent The proof of theorem is following:
Because of the first theorem, so the total energy can be expressed in the following way (ignoring the interaction between nuclei):
\begin{equation}\label{hkpf5}\begin{split}
& E[\rho] \ =\langle \Psi  | \ \hat{T} \ + \ \hat{V}_\textit{int}  \ + \ \hat{V}_\textit{ext} \ | \Psi \rangle \\
&     =\langle \Psi  | \ \hat{T} \ + \ \hat{V}_\textit{int}  \ \ | \Psi \rangle+ \langle \Psi  | \ \hat{V}_\textit{ext} \ | \Psi \rangle \\
&     =\ F[\rho] \ + \ \int \rho(\textbf{r}) V_\textit{ext} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent In the above equation \ref{hkpf5}, the term of $F[\rho]$ is the universal functional since all the systems of electrons.

\noindent Now, let us say $\rho_0$ is the exact ground state electron density, from first theorem, we know there exists one unique external potential $V_\textit{ext}$, so 
the corresponding Hamitonian and wavefunction are $\hat{H}$ and $\Psi_0$, assuming that a different electron density $\rho$ which is not exact ground state density 
corresponding to the wavefunction $\Psi_0$, then we will get:

\begin{equation}
E[\rho_0] = \langle \Psi_0\ |\hat{H}|\ \Psi_0 \rangle 
          < \langle \Psi\ |\hat{H}|\ \Psi \rangle \
          = E[\rho]
\end{equation}

\noindent so from above equation, we know the total energy for the case of exact ground state electron density is lower than any other cases, which also means that one can get 
the exact ground state electron density by minimizing the total energy.



\noindent From those two theorems, we definitely know how to solve this problem theoretically, but in practice, we do not know $E[\rho]$, how it looks like, 
so we still need one more method to deal with it, namely, Kohn-Sham (KS) equation.

\section{The Kohn-Sham equation}

\noindent Since I already introduced the Hartree and Hartree Fock method to solve the many-body problem, both of which are based on the idea which is to transform complex 
many-body problem to single particle problem by using wavefunction, but Density functional theory only consider to take use of information from Hamitonian, but not sovable, 
so is it possbile to combine these two ideas together? the answer is yes,the DFT is solved by Kohn-Sham equation introduced by Kohn and Sham in 1965,
which I recommended a way to construct in the following text (ignoring the interaction between nuclei)

\noindent First of all, the total energy can be expressed by the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{kse}
\begin{split}
&E[\rho] \ =\ T[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{int}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{ext}[\rho]  \\
&\ \ \   = \underbrace{\ (T[\rho] \ - \ T_{0}[\rho]) \ + \  (V_\textit{int}[\rho] \ - \ V_\textit{HF}[\rho])\ }+ \ T_{0}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{HF}[\rho] \ + V_\textit{ext}[\rho]       \\
&\ \ \   = \ T_{0}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{HF}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{C}[\rho] +\ V_\textit{ext}[\rho]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $E[\rho]$  is the total energy, $\rho$ is the ground state density;$V_\textit{int}[\rho]$, $T[\rho]$ and $V_\textit{int}[\rho]$ are the energy from external potential, the exact kinetic 
and the exact electron-electron potential energy; $T_{0}[\rho]$ is the kinetic energy of a non-interacting electrons, $V_\textit{HF}[\rho]$ is the potential  from Hartree-Fock approximation.

\noindent From the Hartree-Fock approximation, we can further know that:
\begin{equation}
 V_\textit{HF}[\rho] \ = \ V_\textit{H}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{X}[\rho] 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V_\textit{H}[\rho]$ and $ V_\textit{X}[\rho] $ are the Hartree contribution and exchange contribution, respectively, so the equation (13) can be further defined like
 the following:
\begin{equation}\label{ccc}
\begin{split}
&E[\rho]\ = \ T_{0}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{H}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{ext}[\rho] \ + \ \underbrace{\ V_\textit{X}[\rho]  \ + \ V_\textit{C}[\rho]}  \\
&\ \ \ = \ T_{0}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{H}[\rho] \ + \ V_\textit{ext}[\rho] + \ V_\textit{XC}[\rho]
\end{split}\end{equation}
\noindent where $V_\textit{XC}[\rho]$  is the exchange-correlation term. From equation \ref{kse}, the explicit expression of $V_\textit{XC}[\rho]$ we do not know. 
 but the first three terms we already know

\begin{equation}
 T_{0}[\rho]\ = \ < \Psi_{i}(\textbf{r}) \ | -\frac{\nabla^{2}_{r}}{2} \ | \Psi_{i}(\textbf{r}) >
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
V_\textit{H}[\rho] \ = \ \frac{1}{2} \int \int \mathrm{d} {\textbf{r}} \mathrm{d}{\textbf{r}^{\prime}} \frac{\rho({\textbf{r}})\rho(\textbf{r}^{\prime})}{|{\textbf{r}}-{\textbf{r}}^{\prime}|} 
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
V_\textit{ext}[\rho]\ = \ \int \mathrm{d}{\textbf{r}} \rho(\textbf{r}) V_\textit{ext} 
\end{equation}

\noindent In order to derive the ground state of the above system, we can view this problem as the process of minimizing the total energy by varying the wavefunction $\Psi^*$, since
we can construct from wavefunction to electron density (equation \ref{ks1}), just like the derivation in the section of Hartree, we finally can get the Kohn-Sham equation.
\begin{equation}\label{aaa}
 (-\frac{\nabla^{2}_{r}}{2}\ + \ V_\textit{KS}) \Psi_{\textit{i}}(\textbf{r}) = E_{\textit{ks}}^{\textit{i}} \Psi_{\textit{i}}(\textbf{r})
\end{equation}

\noindent where
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
&\ V_\textit{KS} \ = \ V_\textit{ext}[\rho] + \int \frac{\rho(\textbf{r}^{\prime})}{|{\textbf{r}}-{\textbf{r}}^{\prime}|} \ + \ \frac{\delta{E_\textit{XC}}}{\delta{\rho(\textbf{r})}} \\
&\ = \ \ V_\textit{ext}[\rho] + \int \frac{\rho(\textbf{r}^{\prime})}{|{\textbf{r}}-{\textbf{r}}^{\prime}|} \ + \ \upsilon_\textit{xc}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent we can think of the Hamiltonian in another point of view, e.g., single particle system with three different potentials. Now the
 problem turns out to be like the single particle form with the degree of freedom of 3.

\noindent So the many-body problem now is transformed to the single electron problem, if the $\upsilon_\textit{xc}$  is exact, the exact ground-state density is :
\begin{equation}\label{ks1}
 \rho(\textbf{r}) = \sumi<i> {\Psi^{*}_{i}(\textbf{r})} {\Psi_{i}(\textbf{r})}
\end{equation}

\noindent There is no total energy equation expression yet, however, if one can change the equation \ref{aaa} as 
\begin{equation}\label{bbb}
\sumi<i> \Psi^{*}_{\textit{i}}(\textbf{r})(-\frac{\nabla^{2}_{i}}{2}\ + \ V_\textit{KS}) \Psi_{\textit{i}}(\textbf{r}) = \sumi<i> \Psi^{*}_{\textit{i}}E_{\textit{ks}}^{\textit{i}} \Psi_{\textit{i}}(\textbf{r})
\end{equation}

\noindent Based on equation \ref{ccc} and \ref{bbb}, we will get the total energy expression:
\begin{equation}\label{totalenergy}
\begin{split}
& E= \sumi<i> E_{\textit{ks}}^{\textit{i}} - \ \frac{1}{2} \int \int \mathrm{d} {\textbf{r}} \mathrm{d}{\textbf{r}^{\prime}} \frac{\rho({\textbf{r}})\rho(\textbf{r}^{\prime})}{|{\textbf{r}}-{\textbf{r}}^{\prime}|} \\
&    + \ V_\textit{XC}[\rho] - \int   \upsilon_\textit{xc} \rho({\textbf{r}})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent So far there are two problems still in the air, one is the exact format of $\upsilon_\textit{xc}$, the other one is how to solve the Kohn-Sham equation.

\section{The exchange-correlation energy}
\noindent This part is the most difficult part during the process of solving the Kohn-Sham equation, because it is unknown so far, so there
 are varies of approximations about it, like the local density approximation (LDA), generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) and
so on.
\subsection{The local density approximation}
\noindent The local density approximation is the simplest way to approximate the exchange-correlation part, and the idea is that the value 
of the exchange-correlation energy in the very tiny small volume is equal to the homogeneous electrons with the same density in 
the volume, the explicit equation is: 
\begin{equation}
 E^\textit{LDA}_\textit{xc} = \int \rho(\textbf{r}) \varepsilon_\textit{xc}( (\rho(\textbf{r})) ) \mathrm{d} \textbf{r} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $ E^\textit{LDA}_\textit{xc} $ is the exchange-correlation energy functional for the $LDA$, $\rho(\textbf{r})$ is the charge density in the position of $\textbf{r}$, $\varepsilon_\textit{xc}$ is homogeneous 
electrons gas with variable of  $\rho(\textbf{r})$ .

\noindent The $\varepsilon_\textit{xc}$ is an ideal state within a solid, which assumes that the charge is homogeneously all over the space:
\begin{equation}
 \rho(\textbf{r}) = \rho = \frac{N}{V}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $N$ is number of electrons within the solid, and $V$ is the volume of solid, which also means that the $\varepsilon_\textit{xc}$ is the function of $\rho(\textbf{r})$,
 not functional. 
\subsection{The Generalized gradient approximation}
\noindent The GGA is the approximation beyond the LDA, which incorporates not only the density within the tiny volume, but also the gradient
 of the density, the explicit equation is:

\begin{equation}
E_{\textit{GGA}}^{\textit{xc}}\ = \ \int \rho(\textbf{r}) \varepsilon_\textit{xc}( (\rho(\textbf{r})), \nabla \rho(\textbf{r}) ) \mathrm{d} \textbf{r} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where  is the exchange-correlation energy functional for the GGA,  is the gradient  of charge density in the position of r.

\noindent Of course, there are more modern methods to approximate the exchange-correlation energy, such as: the optimized effective potential
(OEP) method and the hybrid functionals and so on.

\section{Solving the secular equation}
\noindent The process for solving Kohn-Sham equation can be solved by iteration as well, but the difference between for solving Kohn-Sham 
equation and Hartree or Hartree-fock equation is that the wavefunction is replaced by the electron density, so first an initial 
electron density is defined by some way, and later on the equation is solved iteratively until the reasonable solution is obtained.

\section{Eigenvalue problem}
\noindent In order to solve the equation \ref{aaa}, The Kohn-Sham equation will be transformed into the general eigenvalue problem, first the wavefunction is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{ep1}
 \Psi (r) = \sum\limits_j^N C_j \Phi_j (r)
\end{equation}
 
\noindent Where $C_j$ is a complex number, and $\Phi_j (r)$ is the basis of wavefunction. 

\noindent Now if the Kohn-Sham equation is defined in the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{ep2}
 \hath \Psi (r) = E \Psi (r)
\end{equation}
 
\noindent So if the equation \ref{ep1} is plugged into the equation \ref{ep2}, and then left mupltiply $\Phi_j$ in order, finally it will end up with a set of equations:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{ep3}
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    \Phi_1 \hath \Phi_1 & \Phi_1 \hath \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_1 \hath \Phi_N \\
    \Phi_2 \hath \Phi_1 & \Phi_2 \hath \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_2 \hath \Phi_N \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
    \Phi_N \hath \Phi_1 & \Phi_N \hath \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_N \hath \Phi_N \\
\end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ \vdots \\ C_N\end{array} \right] \\
=E \left[
\begin{matrix}
    \Phi_1 \Phi_1 & \Phi_1 \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_1 \Phi_N \\
   \Phi_2 \Phi_1 & \Phi_2 \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_2 \Phi_N \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
   \Phi_N \Phi_1 & \Phi_N \Phi_2 & \cdots & \Phi_N \Phi_N \\
\end{matrix} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ \vdots \\ C_N\end{array} \right]
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent if we define $H_{ij} = \Phi_i \hath \Phi_j$ and $S_{ij} = \Phi_i \Phi_j$, then the equation \ref{ep3} becomes:

\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{ep4}
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    H_{11} & H_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N} \\
    H_{21} & H_{22} & \cdots & H_{2N} \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
     H_{N1} & H_{N2} & \cdots & H_{NN} \\
\end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ \vdots \\ C_N\end{array} \right] \\
=E \left[
\begin{matrix}
    S_{11} & S_{12} & \cdots & S_{1N} \\
    S_{21} & S_{22} & \cdots & S_{2N} \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
     S_{N1} & S_{N2} & \cdots & S_{NN} \\
\end{matrix} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ \vdots \\ C_N\end{array} \right]
\end{split}\end{equation}

\noindent and after some maniplulations, 

\begin{equation}\label{ep44}
\left[
\begin{matrix}
    H_{11} - E S_{11} & H_{12} - E S_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N} - E S_{1N} \\
   H_{21} - E S_{21} & H_{22} - E S_{22} & \cdots & H_{2N} - E S_{2N} \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
  H_{N1} - E S_{N1} & H_{N2} - E S_{N2} & \cdots & H_{NN} - E S_{NN} \\
\end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} C_1 \\ C_2 \\ \vdots \\ C_N\end{array} \right]
=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent Apparently, the equation \ref{ep44} is an eigenvale problem, in order to get the $C_{ij}$, we have to let:
\begin{equation}\label{ep4}
\left|
\begin{matrix}
    H_{11} - E S_{11} & H_{12} - E S_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N} - E S_{1N} \\
   H_{21} - E S_{21} & H_{22} - E S_{22} & \cdots & H_{2N} - E S_{2N} \\
    \vdots               & \vdots               &        & \vdots               \\
  H_{N1} - E S_{N1} & H_{N2} - E S_{N2} & \cdots & H_{NN} - E S_{NN} \\
\end{matrix} \right|
=0
\end{equation}

\section{Primitive cell, unit cell and Brillouin zone}
\noindent Generally the smallest periodical crystal structure is the primitive cell, and some times, several primitive cells are defined together
in order to reflect the symmetry of the crystal, and this is called as unit cell.

\noindent The copper indium gallium selenium (CIGS) material is taken as an example, which is a tetrahedral bonded semiconductor with the
 chalcopyrite crystal structure. The following \ref{crystr} is the primitive cell of CIGS.

\section{Reciprocal space and Brillouin zone}
\noindent Assuming that there are three primitive basis vectors  $\textbf{a}_{1}$, $\textbf{a}_{2}$ and  $\textbf{a}_{3}$, and if we define that the reciprocal lattice basis vectors
like  $\textbf{b}_{1}$, $\textbf{b}_{2}$ and  $\textbf{b}_{3}$, now we can get:
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
& \textbf{b}_1 = 2 \pi \frac{\textbf{a}_2 \times \textbf{a}_3}{\textbf{a}_1 (\textbf{a}_2 \times \textbf{a}_3)} \\

\section{Band structure and density of state}
\noindent In solid, there are huge amount of atoms which interact each other, so the discrete of energy split into the huge number of state
 with small difference, those are defined as energy band, it is very important if we want to know more about electrons or optical
 properties. So the band structure of CIGS is given as follows:

\chapter{FP-LAPW method}
\section{Introduction}
\noindent So far, We already know how to solve the Kohn-Sham equation, however, there are still two more questions in the air, what is the exact form of 
wavefunction and potential in the realistical calculation ?  

\noindent One maybe naturally choose the a set of plane waves as wavefunction because of bloch theory, but there is a drawback about the plane wave 
when discribing the nearby the atomic core region, because the wavefunction change dramatically, so one needs to choose more plane
waves to define it, which means it will take more time to calculate.

\noindent Slater re-consider the way to discribe the wavefunction, he splits the unit cell into two regions, one is the sphere region which is
defined by the center of atom, but non-overlap each sphere, called muffin tin (MT) region, the remaining region is called interstitial 
(I) region. And an atomic like function is defined as the wavefunction in MT region, this is reason why the method is called augmented plane wave (APW),
 and in the interstitial region wavefunction is discribed as plane wave, which is reasonable, because the wave 
function approaching atomic core is somehow like inside atom, but far away the atomic core, the electron behaves like free electrons,
 so plane wave is suitable. However, the drawback of APW method is the wavefunction is dependent with the energy, which leads to the 
nonlinear eigenvalue problem, so in order to get the exact energy, the method have to decide repeatlly, which is really time-consumming.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% figure of mf and ir
\noindent In order to find a way out, is it possible to let the wavefunction energy-independent?, Andesen and Koelling and Arbman?? proposes a way to discribe that, he notices that
the taylor expansion of radial function, and make use of it to linearize the APW method, so the method is called Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (LAPW) method.
However, the drawback is that this method does not discribe the core state well, so the method is corrected by method of LAPW+LO and LAPW+lo, which is proposed by ?? and ?? respectively.

{\color{red}??????????????????? need to understant more about LAPW+LO and +lo ?????????????????????????} 


\section{Augmented Plane Wave method}
\noindent Slater defines the wavefunction like the following equation:
\begin{comment}
\begin{equation*}\label{ap1}
\phi^{APW}_\textbf{k+G} (\textbf{r})= 
\begin{cases} \frac {1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i(\textbf{k+G})\textbf{r}} & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in I, $}
\\
\sumg<\alpha>\sum\limits_{{\ell}m} f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G} E) Y_{{\ell}m}(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{\alpha})  & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in S_\alpha, $}\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

where $f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G} E) = \sum\limits_{q=1}^{M_{\ell}^{\alpha}} A _{q{\ell}m}^{\alpha}\textbf(k+G) u_{q{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r, E)$

$A _{q{\ell}m}^{\alpha}\textbf(k+G)$ is the expasion coefficients, and $u_{q{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r, E)$  is the radial function, which is dependent with energy $E$, and the
radial function could be decided by the following equation:
\end{comment}


\begin{comment}
\begin{equation*}\label{ap1}
\phi^{APW}_\textbf{k+G} (\textbf{r})= 
\begin{cases} \frac {1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i(\textbf{k+G})\textbf{r}} & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in I, $}
\\
\sumg<\alpha>\sum\limits_{{\ell}m} f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G}, E) Y_{{\ell}m}(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{\alpha})  & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in S_\alpha, $}\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{comment}

\noindent where $f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G} ,E) =  A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G) u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E)$ and $A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G) $is the expasion coefficients, and $u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha} (r_{\alpha}, E)$  is the radial function, which is dependent with energy $E$, and the
radial function could be decided by the following:
\begin{equation}\label{ap2}
(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2}{dr_{\alpha}^2} + \frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2r_{\alpha}^2}+V(r_{\alpha})-E)r_{\alpha}u_{\ell}(r_{\alpha}) = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V(r_{\alpha})$ is the spherical potential. The following is the figure about this basis function

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  figure mt and interstial region

\noindent Because wavefunction has dual representations, one has to make sure the continousiny on the sphere, which is solved by matching each $\ell m$
of the dual representation.

{\color{red}??????????????????? add the representations figure of basis function ?????????????????????????} 


\noindent from the above figure, $ \textbf { r=R^{\alpha}+r_^{\alpha} } $ is guaranteed. so taking use of the Rayleigh expansion formula:
\begin{equation}
\expg<(k+G)>= e^{i \textbf(k+G) \textbf{R}^{\alpha} } 4 \pi \sumlm<\ell><m> i^{\ell} \bessf< |\textbf{k+G}|> \sphfr<\ell{m}><r><> \sphfq<\ell{m}><\textbf{k+G}><*>
\end{equation}
  
\noindent after matching those two representations, the following equation is satisfied:

\begin{equation}
A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G)= \frac{ e^{i \textbf(k+G) \textbf{R}^{\alpha} } 4 \pi \sumlm<\ell><m> i^{\ell} \bessf< |\textbf{k+G}|> \sphfq<\ell{m}><\textbf{k+G}><*> }{\sqrt{\Omega} u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E)}
\end{equation}

\noindent There are two main drawbacks about the APW method:
The first one is that the wavefuntion is energy dependent, which means that the code will search for the energy in order to calculate the exact energy, so it 
is really time consumming.The second one the less harmful, but also sometimes it will cause problem when $u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E) = 0$ during matching. 

\section{Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method}
\noindent In order to decouple the energy and wavefunction, Andersson finds out a way to seperate them, he notices that the taylor expansion of the radail function
on certain energy, which can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
 u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E) = u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) + (E-E_{\ell}) \dot{u}_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell})
\end{equation}

\noindent So he re-defines the wavefuntion in the following way:

\begin{comment}
\begin{equation*}\label{lap1}
\phi^{LAPW}_\textbf{k+G} (\textbf{r})= 
\begin{cases} \frac {1}{\sqrt{\Omega}} e^{i(\textbf{k+G})\textbf{r}} & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in I, $}
\\
\sumg<\alpha>\sum\limits_{{\ell}m} f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G}, E_{\ell}) Y_{{\ell}m}(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{\alpha})  & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in S_\alpha, $}\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
\end{comment}

\noindent where $f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G} ,E_{\ell}) =  A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G) u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) + B _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G) \dot{u}_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell})$
$A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G)$ and $B _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G)$ is the expansion coefficients, and $\dot{u}_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}$ is the derivate of the radial function.

\noindent Here energy $E_{\ell}$  is considered as pre-calculated parameter, actually, it is chosen by the middle of  each l-character band.

\noindent Apparently, LAPW method is more suitable in reality, because the wavefunction is decoupled with energy, but it has to match for two parameters,
fortunaly, even though, it still use less time comparing with APW method. However, there is one drawbacks, what if energy difference is big in the same $ {\ell} $ charater, 
which the $E_{\ell}$ is correct, so this situation will cause big error, these states are called as semi-core state, for example, the alkali metal, the actinides and the rare earths and so on.

\section{Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method + LO}
Comparing with LAPW method, LAPW+LO method extend the basis set, and add smaller number of basis set, which has the following format:


\begin{equation*}\label{lap1}
\phi^{LO}_\textbf{k+G} (\textbf{r})= 
\begin{cases} 0 & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in I, $}
\\
(A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha}  u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) + B _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha}  \dot{u}_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) + C _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha}  u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E^{\prime}_{\ell})){Y_{{\ell}m}(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{\alpha})} & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in S_\alpha, $}\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
 
\noindent where $A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha}$ and $B _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha}$ is matching value and derivate on the sphere boundary to zero, but not plane wave, like LAPW did before, and $E^{\prime}_{\ell}$ is
the chosen energy from semi-core state.

\section{Augmented Plane Wave method plus local orbitals}
\noindent Actually, there is one more method which will deal with the energy-denpendent case, which is called as Augmented Plane Wave method plus local orbitals (APW+lo), the 
basis function has two kinds, one is similar with equation \ref{lap1}, but only without the derivative terms, e.g., $f_{{\ell}{m}} (r_{\alpha},\textbf{k+G} ,E_{\ell}) =  A _{{\ell}m}^{\alpha} \textbf(k+G) u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell})$.
And another basis function is:
\begin{equation*}\label{lap3}
\phi^{lo}_\textbf{k+G} (\textbf{r})= 
\begin{cases} 0 & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in I, $}
\\
(A _{{\ell}m,lo}^{\alpha}  u_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) + B _{{\ell}m,lo}^{\alpha}  \dot{u}_{{\ell}}^{\alpha}(r_{\alpha}, E_{\ell}) ){Y_{{\ell}m}(\hat{\textbf{r}}_{\alpha})} & \quad \mbox{if $\textbf{r} \in S_\alpha, $}\\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
 
\noindent And the value of $A _{{\ell}m,lo}^{\alpha}$ and $B _{{\ell}m,lo}^{\alpha}$ are obtained by normalization and local orbital has zero value at the muffin tin boundary.

\chapter{K $\cdot$ P method}

%%%%%%modify the sentences below


The band dispersion can be obtained by using the kp method, the basic idea will be explained in the following text.
First, The Bloch Theory shows:

\begin{equation}\label{1}
 \wfbloch<n><k> = \expg<k> \ubloch<n><k>
\end{equation}

where $\wfbloch<n><k>$ is the wave function on k point for the {\textit n}th band, and $\expg<k>$ is plane wave, $\ubloch<n><k>$ is a function which has the same a periodicity as the potential.

Now let us suppose the wavefunction and energy are obtained by some procedures on $k_0$ point, $\wfbloch<n><k_0>$ is the wavefunction and $\ebloch<n><k_0>$ is the energy.
And another function is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{2}
\chikp<n><k> = \expg<(k-k_0)> \wfbloch<n><k_0>
\end{equation}


The above function $\chikp<n><k> $ is expanded as wave function on $k$ point, and then the wave function on the $k$ point is calculated by:
\begin{equation}\label{3}
\wfbloch<n><k> =  {\sum\limits_{j}} C_{n,j}^{k} \chikp<n><k> 
\end{equation}

From above equation, the wave function is known if the coefficient $C_{n,j}^{k}$ is obtained, let us substitute the equation \ref{3} into Kohn-Sham equation.
\begin{equation}\label{4}
\left\{ \frac {{\textbf p}^2} {2m} + V({\textbf r}) \right\} \wfbloch<n><k> = \ebloch<n><k> \wfbloch<n><k>
\end{equation} 

then we will finally get the following equation.
\begin{equation}\label{5}
{\sum\limits_{j}}  C_{n,j}^{k} \left \{  \left [  \ebloch<j><k_0> -  \ebloch<n><k>  + \frac{{\hbar}^2}{2m} {\textbf (k^2-k_0^2)}    \right ] \delta_{j',j} + \frac{\hbar}{m} {\textbf(k-k_0)} {\textbf p_{j',j}} \right \} = 0
\end{equation}

where ${\textbf p_{j',j}} = \langle \ubloch<j'><k_0>| {\textbf p} | \ubloch<j><k_0>  \rangle $.
 
We also can simpify the above equation in the following format:
\begin{equation}\label{6}
{\sum\limits_{j}} C_{n,j}^{k} \left \{ H_{j',j}- \ebloch<n><k> \delta_{j',j} \right \} =0
\end{equation}

where
\begin{equation} \label{7}
H_{j',j} = \left [  \ebloch<j><k_0>  + \frac{{\hbar}^2}{2m} {\textbf (k^2-k_0^2)}    \right ] \delta_{j',j} + \frac{\hbar}{m} {\textbf(k-k_0)} {\textbf p_{j',j}}
\end{equation}

From the above equation, we can calculate the coefficient $ C_{n,j}^{k}$.


\begin{comment}
Actually, if substituting the equation \ref{1} into equation \ref{4}, the analytical expression of band dispersion can be obtained.
 \begin{equation} \begin{split}\label{8}
& \ebloch<n><k> {\expg<k> \ubloch<n><k>} = \left\{ \frac {{\textbf p}^2} {2m} + V({\textbf r}) \right\} {\expg<k> \ubloch<n><k>} \\
& = \expg<k> \left \{ \frac {{\textbf p}^2} {2m} + V({\textbf r}) +  \frac {{\textbf k}^2 \hbar^2 } {2m}  + \frac { \hbar {\textbf k \cdot p}} {m}  \right\} \ubloch<n><k>
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

so 
 \begin{equation} \label{9}
\ebloch<n><k> {\ubloch<n><k>} = \left \{ \frac {{\textbf p}^2} {2m} + V({\textbf r}) +  \frac {{\textbf k}^2 \hbar^2 } {2m}  + \frac { \hbar {\textbf k \cdot p}} {m}  \right\} \ubloch<n><k>
\end{equation}
